## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
This project has resulted from my preparations for the interviews for the SWE at Google. 
Hope that it will help you land a job at your dream company.
